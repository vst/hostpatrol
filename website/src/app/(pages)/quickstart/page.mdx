# Quickstart

## Step 1. Install

First, download the executable _(for Linux x86_64 only)_:

```sh
curl -Lo /tmp/hostpatrol https://github.com/vst/hostpatrol/releases/latest/download/hostpatrol-static-linux-x86_64
```

Then, install it to your `$PATH`:

```sh
sudo install /tmp/hostpatrol /usr/local/bin/hostpatrol
```

_(or see [below](#nix-profile) for how to install it using Nix profile)_

## Step 2. Patrol

```sh
hostpatrol compile --host my-host-1 --host my-host-2 > hostpatrol_report.json
```

## Step 3. Render

1. Go to [Web UI](https://www.hostpatrol.io/report)
2. Load your report `hostpatrol_report.json`

Done! Read following for more information.

## Install to Nix Profile

For the current development version:

```sh
nix profile install --file https://github.com/vst/hostpatrol/archive/main.tar.gz app
```

For versioned release:

```sh
nix profile install --file https://github.com/vst/hostpatrol/archive/v<VERSION>.tar.gz app
```

## Configuration File

Instead of providing hosts one-by-one, you can use a configuration
file. For example given a configuration file `config.yaml` like this:

```yaml showLineNumbers
## List of known SSH public keys for all hosts.
knownSshKeys:
  - gh:some-github-user
  - ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKq9bpy0IIfDnlgaTCQk0YhKyKFqInRjoqeIPlBuiFwS test-key-admin

## List of hosts to patrol
hosts:
  - ## Name of the host (required)
    name: somehost
    ## SSH configuration (optional)
    ssh:
      ## SSH destination (required)
      destination: root@10.10.10.10
      ## SSH options (optional)
      options: ['-i', '/keys/hebele.pri']
    ## External identifier of the host (optional)
    id: 20b88669-743f-4ae5-9823-5aacc2df7086
    ## External URL for the host (optional)
    url: https://internal.documentation/hosts/somehost
    ## List of tags for the host (optional)
    tags:
      - oranges
      - strawberries
    ## Arbitrary JSON data for the host (optional)
    data:
      owner: Client-1
      cost: 50
    ## List of known SSH public keys for the host (optional)
    knownSshKeys:
      - gh:another-github-user
      - ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGmlBxUagOqtWcW6B77TUL8li85ZNYx0tphd3TSx4SEB test-key-tenant
  - name: otherhost
    url: https://internal.documentation/hosts/otherhost
    tags:
      - apples
      - strawberries
```

You can compile the report like this:

```sh
hostpatrol compile --config config.yaml > hostpatrol_report.json
```

The benefit of using a configuration file is to provide additional
information about the hosts, such as external identifiers, URLs, tags,
and arbitrary JSON data. Also, you can provide known SSH public keys
for each host and/or for the whole configuration.

Furthermore, you can mix the configuration file with the command-line hosts:

```sh
hostpatrol compile --config config.yaml --host my-host-1 --host my-host-2 > hostpatrol_report.json
```

Host Patrol connects to hosts in parallel and ignores all failed hosts
by reporting such errors in the output. To change the maximum number
of threads used for concurrent patrols, use `--threads` option that
defaults to 4. For example, to use 10 threads, run the following
command:

```sh
hostpatrol compile --threads 10 --config config.yaml > hostpatrol_report.json
```
